Pre-requisites

Lab Cli
----------

A command line client is provided called `lab` in the style of a similarly named
tool `hub` for GitHub. From source you can run as:

``` shell
dune exec cli/lab.exe -- <arguments>
```

If you opam install lab then the executable is available as `lab`.

GITLAB_DEBUG=[true|false] for printing debug information like what HTTP requests and responses occur.
GITLAB_URL to configure the GitLab instance to connect to. This defaults to `https://gitlab.com/api/v4` on the public `https://github.com` site.

Run `lab -h` for more information about cli options.
