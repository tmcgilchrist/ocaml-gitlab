      "# Context\r\n\r\nWith the upcoming OCaml V5 comes the long-awaited [effect handlers](https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/multicore-ocaml-september-2021-effect-handlers-will-be-in-ocaml-5-0/8554). Effect handlers have been all the rage these last years in Haskell world, some languages like [Unison](https://www.unisonweb.org/) even building them in their language directly.\r\n\r\n# Objective\r\n\r\nWe propose to explore using effect handlers in Tezos both to replace existing monads that are subsumed by effects handlers:\r\n\r\n* the Error monad,\r\n* the Lwt monad,\r\n* the [combined Lwt/Error monad](https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos/-/blob/7cc52324f64e6f442acbf59e0b71390b887b27db/src/lib_lwt_result_stdlib/bare/sigs/monad.ml#L254)\r\n\r\nbut also to support effects that are currently hand-crafted/manually coded/coupled, e.g.:\r\n\r\n* the monad for reading/writing [Context.t](https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos/-/blob/7cc52324f64e6f442acbf59e0b71390b887b27db/src/lib_protocol_environment/environment_context.ml#L99) (which would be the [State](https://wiki.haskell.org/State_Monad) monad in Haskell terms),\r\n* the readonly Context.t monad (the [Reader](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mtl-2.2.2/docs/Control-Monad-Reader.html) monad).\r\n* the logging monad (events in Tezos terms)\r\n\r\nAn additional benefit of effect handlers is that they simplify testability: a business function could have the effects \"Logging, State Context, Error\" and a test could easily \"mock\" how these effects behave inside the test (by simply changing the effect handler).\r\nHere's an [example in Haskell](https://sir4ur0n.github.io/posts/polysemy-tests.html) but the idea would be the same.\r\n\r\n# Success criterion\r\n\r\nThis project is concerned with practical integration of effects handlers within the tezos/tezos codebase. The project will be a success if one of these criterion is met:\r\n\r\n* One or more packages are modified to use effects handlers, hereby showing by example what it means to use them and what it implies in terms of code readibility.\r\n* Reasons why using effects handlers in tezos/tezos is impossible and/or impractical. For example, because the use is too heavyweight. In this case, we expect pointers to possible improvements to effects handlers - that would change this outcome - to have been explored and documented.",

      "TZS is a language for describing implementation-independent validation\r\nscenarios for the Tezos economic properties and a system for\r\nexecuting and validating such scenarios.\r\n\r\nThe first benefit of TZS is that it allows to assert\r\nbehaviors of the protocol without delving into the details of its\r\nimplementation. It is more high-level than TZT, which aims to\r\nassert the behavior of Michelson snippets. TZS authors will have less\r\nprotocol-boilerplate to deal with to write scenarios, as opposed to\r\nwhen writing \"classic\" protocol-integration tests or system tests.\r\n\r\nThe second is that it can be used to validate other implementations of\r\nthe economic protocol, or specific sub-components thereof (such has as\r\nthe Michelson interpreter).\r\n\r\nFor more details and motivation, see: https://hackmd.io/v9zHVliuR3mv_jrOU40SAw?view\r\n",

      "# Unittezts project\r\n\r\nThe test suite of octez is highly fractured. We currently use the\r\nfollowing test frameworks:\r\n\r\n\r\n  - system tests: pytest, tezt and flextesa\r\n  - unit tests: alcotest, qcheck (mostly launched through alcotest),\r\n    ppx_expect (or ppx_inline test) and ad-hoc ocaml unit tests,\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to make the test suite more coherent by\r\nreplacing alcotest by Tezt. As pointed out in issue #1265, Tezt now\r\nhas all the features of Alcotest, in addition to many features that\r\nimprove developer experience (e.g. test selection) and that\r\nfacilitates CI integration (e.g. load balancing). In addition,\r\nreducing the number of tools decreases productivity losses induced by\r\ndeveloper context switches.\r\n\r\nHowever, some technical issues (also discussed in the issue #1265)\r\nshould be resolved to migrate Alcotest to Tezt:\r\n\r\n - How can we keep package-level tests while integrating them all in a\r\n   global test suite?\r\n - How will tezt unit tests be launched when installing opam packages\r\n   `--with-test`\r\n - Unit tests are typically launched through `dune runtest` that runs\r\n   tests in parallel. in my experience, this shortens wall-time test\r\n   time by 1/2 - 1/3 on my machine as opposed to running tests\r\n   sequentially. Should we implement parallel test execution in Tezt?\r\n\r\nThe project should resolve the issues mentioned above, and produce a\r\nproof of concept by translating the unit tests of at least one package\r\nin the source tree (e.g. `src/lib_base`).\r\n\r\n# Notes by Romain\r\n\r\nhttps://codimd.nomadic-labs.com/rmAqM73dS2uiVCj2wRR5Yg\r\n",

    "description":
      "The Transaction Rollup project aims ta providing a ad-hoc optimistic solution to Tezos with the following properties:\r\n\r\n1. Implemented at the protocol layer (that is, in OCaml), to have a gas- and space-efficient implementation\r\n2. Limited to transactions (no in-rollup smart contracts), to keep the scope of the project smaller\r\n3. Fast finality thanks to a non-interactive rejection scheme.\r\n\r\nThis [board](https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos/-/boards/3817494?milestone_title=Transaction+Rollups) can make it easier to understand what is being actively worked on.\r\n\r\nThereafter, we explain the plan wrt. merge requests.\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Completed phase(s)</summary>\r\n\r\n# Phase 1. Creation\r\n\r\n- [x] [!3915](https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos/-/merge_requests/3915) adds the layer-1 operation to originate a transaction rollup\r\n- [x] [!4198](https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos/-/merge_requests/4198) improves the API related to a transaction rollup state</details>\r\n\r\n# Phase 2. Layer-1-to-layer-2 communication\r\n\r\nThis phase introduces in the protocol the “inboxes” of the transaction rollups, along with the way to fill them, and to interpret them.\r\n\r\n- [ ] [!4315](https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos/-/merge_requests/4315) improves the documentation available in the [Tezos manual](http://tezos.gitlab.io/alpha/transaction_rollups.html) to take into account the development of this phase.\r\n\r\n## 2.A. In the layer-1\r\n\r\n- [x] [!4190](https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos/-/merge_requests/4190) makes it easier for the project to rely on the global table of tickets infrastructure\r\n- [x] [!4200](https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos/-/merge_requests/4200) provides the API to register “messages” in the layer-1, that the layer-2 needs to interpret\r\n- [x] [!4205](https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos/-/merge_requests/4205) makes it possible to target something that is not a smart contract or an implicit account with a layer-1 `Transaction` operation\r\n- [x] [!4203](https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos/-/merge_requests/4203) introduces a new layer-1 operation to submit batches of transactions the layer-2 needs to interpret\r\n- [ ] [!4017](https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos/-/merge_requests/4017) allows smart contracts to deposit ticket to the layer-2 with a layer-1 `Transaction` operation\r\n\r\n## 2.B. In the layer-2\r\n\r\nReference implementation can be found at [!3921](https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos/-/merge_requests/3921). The following MR are a revamp of this initial implemenation.\r\n\r\n- [ ] [!4275](https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos/-/merge_requests/4275) introduces the definition of the layer-2 batches, and a novel framework to write compact encoding for them.\r\n- [ ] [!4360](https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos/-/merge_requests/4360) introduces the notion of layer-2 context, with extensive testing\r\n- [ ] `WIP` introduces the notion of layer-2 apply function, with extensive testing\r\n\r\n# Phase 3. Commitments\r\n\r\nThe goal of this phase is to provide the notion of commitments to the transaction rollups. A commitment is a way for a rollup node to advertise to the layer-1 participants the advancement of the layer-2. This also includes a way to reject erroneous or malicious commitments.\r\n\r\n## 3.A. In the layer-1\r\n\r\nReference MR is [!4162](https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos/-/merge_requests/4162). The idea is to gradually extract self-contained MR from it, to reduce the workload on reviewers, and the history-rewriting nightmare that can be splitting it in several MRs at once.\r\n\r\n- [ ] [!4323](https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos/-/merge_requests/4323) refactors yet another time the `Ticket_hash` module\r\n- [ ] [!4332](https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos/-/merge_requests/4332) refines the implementation of inboxes to make them a linked list\r\n\r\n## 3.B. In the rollup node\r\n\r\n- [ ] `WIP` introduces a passive transaction rollup node that reconstructs the inboxes.\r\n\r\n# Phase 4. Layer-2-to-layer-1 communication\r\n\r\nThe goal of this phase is to implement the mechanism which allows transaction rollup participants to withdraw their assets from the layer-2.\r\n\r\n# Phase 5. Activation\r\n\r\nThe goal of this phase is to enable the transaction rollup feature flag, to make the implementation available on mainnet.\r\n\r\n# Nice to have\r\n\r\nThe following MRs are not blocking, and should potentially be added to TORU in another iteration of the protocol if need be.\r\n\r\n- [ ] [!4309](https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos/-/merge_requests/4309) refines the fees logic implemented in !4200 to smooth the variation of the fees\r\n- [ ] [!4344](https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos/-/merge_requests/4344) allows to provide an upper bound for the fees you are willing to pay",

      "The goals of this project is at the intersection of the development of new features for the storage as whole, that can be located in the store itself or on components interacting directly with it, and maintenance and bug fixes of the store.\r\n\r\n## Crew mumbers\r\n- Victor Allombert (@vect0r, DRI, PA)\r\n- (more to come?)\r\n\r\n# 1. Improving the context (ledger state)\r\n\r\nThe improvement of the context consists in following the development of the [Irmin](https://github.com/mirage/irmin/) and [Index](https://github.com/mirage/index) libraries developed by Tarides and to report bugs or issues to them. It also tracks improvement related to the activation of Hangzhou.\r\n\r\n## Step one: Index\r\n\r\nThe [Index](https://github.com/mirage/index) is in charge of indexing the Irmin's pack backend which stores the data as a \"raw\" append only file. The index indexs all objects of a context, that is to say all nodes and leaves (even leaves containing values smaller than a hash). It results, for a recent mainnet archive node,  in a `55Gb` index file referencing `1.3` billon entries -- which is huge. Because of it, very costly (in terms of memory, IOs and time) merges (or maintenance procedure) are required. Additionally, the index lookup is slow and breaks various cache mechanisms from the operating system (as it requires to load a lot of \"pages\" in memory). Finally, a big file with so many entries is more likely to be subject of data corruptions.\r\n\r\nTo solve theses issues and relax the Index's bottleneck, several steps are considered:\r\n- [x] optimize the current implementation\r\n    - Changed the implementation of the write-ahead log to significantly reduce its\r\nmemory usage (at the cost of some additional disk IO). [#355](https://github.com/mirage/index/pull/355)\r\n    - Release Index 1.4.2 (https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos/-/merge_requests/3679)\r\n    - !3679: Update to irmin.2.8.\r\n    - !3735: Context: reduces memory usage peak of the context flattening \r\n- [ ] Index less elements to be lighter and faster: Irmin 3.0\r\n    - [#1695](https://github.com/mirage/irmin/issues/1695) Irmin 3.0\r\n    - [#1510 merged](https://github.com/mirage/irmin/pull/1510)\r\n    - [#1534 closed](https://github.com/mirage/irmin/pull/1534)\r\n    - may require a context upgrade (actually it is more like a cleanup) to perform better\r\n- [ ] Alternative index implementations. @tomjridge who is currently working on exploring alternatives to replace the Index implementation (in particular, B-trees). Achieving the inter-process concurrency semantics is challenging and there are not many existing implementations that meet the right parameters, but we’re hopeful that a more scalable design can be found.\r\n\r\n## Step two: Irmin\r\n\r\nThe mission for the layered store project is to integrate and test the layered store backend of [Irmin](https://github.com/mirage/irmin/). This layered store aims to provide native garbage collection and also to improve the overall performances of the context.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the layered store is considered as working and is fully integrated in Irmin. However, it does not scale with Octez as the Index's bottleneck is to important.\r\n\r\n- [X] (~High priority~) Optimize the snapshot import, as a quick fix at least\r\n- [ ] (High ~Medium~ priority) Restructure the snapshot export/import to enable better performances and lower memory footprint #2312 \r\n- [X] [Irmin.2.10](https://github.com/mirage/irmin/releases/tag/2.10.0)\r\n    - Adds tree proofs\r\n- [ ] integrate the layered store (this work was partially done thanks to previous attempts [2127](https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos/-/merge_requests/2127))\r\n- [ ] test it with typical data sets\r\n\r\n## Next blurry steps\r\n\r\n- [ ] Introduce a dedicated implementation for TenderBake\r\n- [ ] Optimize the overall performances \r\n- [ ] Allow more resilient storage\r\n- [ ] Introduce tools to fix corrupted storage\r\n- [ ] Reduce the memory footprint (aka optimize stored representation)\r\n\r\n# 2. Maintenance, improvement and bug fixes of the store (block history)\r\n\r\nHere, we aim to maintain an improve the store by:\r\n- resolving the followup issues from the [Store rehaul MR](https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos/-/issues/1512),\r\n- resolving `TODO` and `FIXME` present in the store's code,\r\n- fix bug/emergencies directly related to the store. \r\n\r\nAs the activation of Hangzhou requires users to use the `v11` release, many issues may be encountered as the number of users of the `v0.0.6` store is increasing.\r\n\r\n# 3. Development of dependencies\r\n\r\nAs the storage is a low level component which interacts with many other components, it is required to rework some parts of the code to allows better performances and a higher confidence.",
